## About

This project investigates the use of a Stroop test on a sample population and utilizes descriptive statistics to interpret the results.

The following steps are followed in my investigation:

   - A brief description of data including dependent and independent variables.
   - Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis are explained.
   - Finding the mean, standard deviation, and standard error.
   - The Stroop test is validated by finding the critical intervals on sampling data.
   - Results are the critical values, p-value, t-statistics and degrees of freedom.
