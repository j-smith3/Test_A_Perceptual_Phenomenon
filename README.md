# Test_A_Perceptual_Phenomenon
This project investigates the use of a Stroop test on a sample population and utilizes descriptive statistics to interpret the results.

The following steps are followed in my investigation:

   - A brief description of data including dependent and independent variables.
   - Hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis are explained.
   - Finding the mean, standard deviation, and standard error.
   - The Stroop test is validated by finding the critical intervals on sample data.
   - Resulted in the critical values, p-value, t-statistics and degrees of freedom.
